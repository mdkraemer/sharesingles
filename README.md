## Differences between lifelong singles and partnered individuals in personality traits and life satisfaction

We will use the SHARE dataset to investigate group differences in Big 5 personality traits and life satisfaction among European people who have been single their entire life, as compared to those who entered a committed relationship at some point. We will further investigate regional differences and potential moderator variables. 

Research questions: 
* How do lifelong singles and non-singles differ in their self-reported Big 5 personality traits and life satisfaction?  
* Are there differences in Big 5 personality traits and life satisfaction among the different groups of lifelong singles (never married vs. never cohabiting vs. never had a serious relationship)?  
* Which variables moderate the relationship between Big 5 personality traits and life satisfaction with being lifelong single vs. not?   
* Are there geographical differences in life satisfaction or Big 5 personality traits among lifelong singles?
